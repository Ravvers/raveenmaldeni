					In my spare time I like to work on projects that are shared

					a wide variety of problems throughout the development
					process so that I can <HighlightText>learn</HighlightText>{" "}
					about all parts of project development. In addition to this,
					I want to be involved in creating something that makes a{" "}
					<HighlightText>difference</HighlightText> in others' lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of my main goals is to design and create my own
					videogame as they have been a large part of my life. This
					has finally given me the confidence to explore art and
					drawing, so I'll be sharing some of that here too!
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not coding you might find me playing competitive
					video games, playing chess, jamming on my guitar and
					singing, or ice skating at my local rink.
